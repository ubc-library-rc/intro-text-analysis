![1.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/content/1.PNG)


## Terminology

**Corpus:** The source text that will be analyzed. It can be a single text (_Great Expectations_) or a combination of texts (all of Jane Austen's books).

**N-gram:** Looks for the repetition of a contiguous sequence of n (any number) of items from the source text.

**Name entity recognition:** Analyzing the text and retrieving name entities such as names, countries, dates, etc.

**Tokens:** Words, phrases, sentences that are used for text analysis. Tokenization prepares the text for text analysis.

**Topic modeling:** A statistical model to divide the words in the source text into a set number of topics.
