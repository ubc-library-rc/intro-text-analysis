# Activities for Voyant

### Word Cloud (Cirrus, Terms, Links) 

 1. What words are most prominent? How do you know?
 2. Spend some time exploring:

  -  What happens when you hover your mouse over different parts of the Cirrus widget?
  -  What happens when you click on a word?
  -  What hidden buttons can you find?
  -  Find the “Options” button and edit or view the list of “Stopwords.” Does this change your results?

 3. What do we learn about the text from this Word Cloud?
