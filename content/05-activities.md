# Activities for Voyant

 ![voyant-austen-numbered.png]({{site.baseurl}}/content/voyant-austen-numbered.png)


 1. **Cirrus -** What do we learn about the text from this Word Cloud?

 Let's spend some time exploring:

  -  What happens when you hover your mouse over different parts of the Cirrus widget?
  -  What happens when you click on a word?
  -  What hidden buttons can you find?
  -  Find the “Options” button and edit or view the list of “Stopwords.” Does this change your results?


 2. **Trends:** an efficient corpus reader that fetches segments of text as you scroll

 - How are words in the “trends” widget chosen for inclusion?
 - What kind of information to the trend lines, x- and y- axes
convey?
 - What does the graph tell us about the story?
 - Bonus Question: What is the difference between relative and raw frequencies and how do you find that information?
