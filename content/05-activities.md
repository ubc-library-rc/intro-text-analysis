# Activities for Voyant

### First Activity - Creating a Corpus

- open an existing corpus (click on the "Open" button under the text box)
- type or paste text into the main text box (this creates a corpus with one document)
- type or paste one or more URLs into the main text box (one URL per line)
- click the "Upload" button under the text box to use files from your compute

### Second Activity - Exploring a Corpus

- Once you create a corpus you will arrive at the default "skin" or arrangement of tools. There is a lot happening at once, but we'll start by [describing the tools that you see and how they can interact](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=be22b2b7a30b32b09fbd0ed7aa2e62d6).

### For this Session: 

  At first you will see three tool panels along the top and two tool panels along the bottom:

- [Cirrus](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/cirrus): a kind of word cloud showing the most frequent terms
- [Text Reader](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/reader): an efficient corpus reader that fetches segments of text as you scroll
- [Trends](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/trends): a distribution graph showing terms across the corpus (or terms within a document)
- [Summary](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/summary): a tool that provides a simple, textual overview of the current corpus
- [Contexts](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/contexts): a concordance that shows each occurrence of a keyword with a bit of surrounding context
