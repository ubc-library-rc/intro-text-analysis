 1. Spend some time exploring:

  -  What happens when you hover your mouse over different parts of the Cirrus widget?
  -  What happens when you click on a word?
  -  What hidden buttons can you find?
  -  Find the “Options” button and edit or view the list of “Stopwords.” Does this change your results?

 2. What do we learn about the text from this Word Cloud?

4. Trends: an efficient corpus reader that fetches segments of text as you scroll

 - How are words in the “trends” widget chosen for inclusion?
 - What kind of information to the trend lines, x- and y- axes
convey?
 - What does the graph tell us about the story?
 - Bonus Question: What is the difference between relative and raw frequencies and how do you find that information?

5. Extra Bonus Question: Is this a helpful? What might affect the
value of this visualization?
