## Voyant

In this part, we will learn about:

- basic information about Voyant (essential background about the tool and its design)
- how to create (or use) a Voyant corpus (especially with URLs and file uploads)
- how to begin exploring a corpus in Voyant (the default tools and their interactions)
- digging deeper into Voyant functionality (power searches, working with grids, additional tools)

### Uploading a text document to Voyant

- Let's use a text from Project Gutenberg.  
- Moby Dick - [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/)
- Copy and paste the URL of _Moby Dick_ [.txt file](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/) of _Moby Dick_

- Now add [_Jane Eyre_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1260/)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/content/voyant.PNG)

- Once you create a corpus you will arrive at the default "skin" or arrangement of tools. There is a lot happening at once, but we'll start by [describing the tools that you see and how they can interact](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=ee5cd6f93a86c993596bffdf88a89cb9).
