## Voyant

In this part, we will learn about:

- basic information about Voyant (essential background about the tool and its design)
- how to create (or use) a Voyant corpus (especially with URLs and file uploads)
- how to begin exploring a corpus in Voyant (the default tools and their interactions)
- digging deeper into Voyant functionality (power searches, working with grids, additional tools)

Activity #1:

### Compare the copy-and-paste versus uploading a text document to Voyant

- Let's use a text from Internet Archive
- Moby Dick - [https://archive.org/details/mobydickorwhale01melvuoft/page/n8/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/mobydickorwhale01melvuoft/page/n8/mode/2up)
- Download a .txt file of _Moby Dick_
- Copy and paste the entire _Moby Dick_ text from the html

### Creating a Corpus

- open an existing corpus (click on the "Open" button under the text box)
- type or paste text into the main text box (this creates a corpus with one document)
- type or paste one or more URLs into the main text box (one URL per line)
- click the "Upload" button under the text box to use files from your compute

### Exploring a Corpus

- Once you create a corpus you will arrive at the default "skin" or arrangement of tools. There is a lot happening at once, but we'll start by describing the tools that you see and how they can interact.

### Default Skin

  At first you will see three tool panels along the top and two tool panels along the bottom:

- Cirrus: a kind of word cloud showing the most frequent terms
- Reader: an efficient corpus reader that fetches segments of text as you scroll
- Trends: a distribution graph showing terms across the corpus (or terms within a document)
- Summary: a tool that provides a simple, textual overview of the current corpus
- Contexts: a concordance that shows each occurrence of a keyword with a bit of surrounding context
