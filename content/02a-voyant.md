## Voyant

In this part, we will learn about:

- basic information about Voyant (essential background about the tool and its design)
- how to create (or use) a Voyant corpus (especially with URLs and file uploads)
- how to begin exploring a corpus in Voyant (the default tools and their interactions)
- digging deeper into Voyant functionality (power searches, working with grids, additional tools)

### Uploading a text document to Voyant

- Let's use a text from Project Gutenberg.  
- Moby Dick - [https://archive.org/details/mobydickorwhale01melvuoft/page/n8/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/mobydickorwhale01melvuoft/page/n8/mode/2up)
- Choice #1 - Download a [.txt file](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/) of _Moby Dick_
- Choice #2 - Copy and paste the entire _Moby Dick_ text from the html 

- Try repeating with [_Jane Eyre_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1260/)

- Once you create a corpus you will arrive at the default "skin" or arrangement of tools. There is a lot happening at once, but we'll start by [describing the tools that you see and how they can interact](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=be22b2b7a30b32b09fbd0ed7aa2e62d6).
