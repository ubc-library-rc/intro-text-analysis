# Tools and Methods

Computationally-driven text analysis is utilized in a variety of disciplines and connects humanist scholars to linguists, social scientists, computer scientists, and statisticians. Text analysis looks at elements such as word frequencies, co-occurrence, and statistically generated ‘topics’ to perform ‘distant reading’ of large collections (such as a corpus of [Charles Darwin's letters](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/darwin) or 100+ years of [BC Historical Newspapers](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/bcnewspapers)). 

Digital humanists usually perform this analysis with the help of algorithms developed by computer scientists, statisticians, and linguists. Depending on the individual researcher’s level of programming skill, they can make use of specialized text analysis libraries in the Python or R programming languages, or use out-of-the-box tools like MALLET and Paper Machines.

In this workshop, we focus on two tools:

- **Voyant Tools**

Voyeur is a web-based text analysis environment. It is designed to be user-friendly, flexible and powerful.

- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**

NLTK is intended to support research and teaching in natural language processing, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine learning.  The NLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and building research systems.
