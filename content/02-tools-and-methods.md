# Tools and Methods

Computationally-driven text analysis is utilized in a variety of disciplines and connects humanist scholars to linguists, social scientists, computer scientists, and statisticians. Text analysis looks at elements such as word frequencies, co-occurrence, and statistically generated ‘topics’ to perform ‘distant reading’ of large collections (such as a corpus of [Charles Darwin's letters](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/darwin) or 100+ years of [BC Historical Newspapers](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/bcnewspapers)). 

Depending on your level of programming skill, you can make use of specialized text analysis libraries in the Python or R programming languages, or use out-of-the-box tools like MALLET and Paper Machines.

In this workshop, we focus on the following two tools:

- **Voyant Tools**

Voyeur is a web-based text analysis environment. It is designed to be user-friendly, flexible and powerful.

- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**

NLTK is intended to support research and teaching in natural language processing, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine learning.  The NLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and building research systems.
