### **Objectives of Workshop**

> In the slippage between our literary notion of a text and the computer's literal processing lie the disappointment and the possibility of text analysis.  Computers cannot understand a text for us.  They can, however, do things that may surprise us.

 [_Hermeneutica_, Geoffrey Rockwell and Stefan Sinclair](http://hermeneuti.ca/).  

Text analysis can help researchers see and query their data in new ways through word frequency, patterns, and contexts.  This workshop will introduce participants to common tools and methods for programmatic text analysis and walk them through beginner and intermediate workflows and exercises using Voyant â€“ a free, online software that creates visualizations of text - and the Python programming language tool called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).  We have set up this workshop into two parts:

Part 1

- how to use Voyant and get a grasp on what's available (how to use it)
- how to think differently about texts with tools such as Voyant (why use it)
- There is a hosted version of Voyant Tools ([https://voyant-tools.org](https://voyant-tools.org))
but we very strongly encourage anyone following along to download and launch the desktop version. 

Part 2

- Introduction to NLP Theory
- The NLTK Corpus (Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Stemming)
- For Python, please login into UBC Syzygy - [https://ubc.syzygy.ca/](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/)
