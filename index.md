# Introduction to Text Analysis from Voyant to NLTK

## Objectives of Workshop


Text analysis can help researchers see and query their data in new ways through word frequency, patterns, and contexts.  This workshop will introduce participants to common tools and methods for programmatic text analysis and walk them through beginner and intermediate workflows and exercises using Voyant â€“ a free, online software that creates visualizations of text - and the Python programming language tool called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

In this workshop, we focus on the following two tools:

- **Voyant Tools**

Voyeur is a web-based text analysis environment. It is designed to be user-friendly, flexible and powerful.

- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**

NLTK is intended to support research and teaching in natural language processing, including empirical linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and machine learning.  The NLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and building research systems.
